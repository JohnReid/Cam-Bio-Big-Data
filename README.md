# Cambridge bioinformatics and big data training resources
This repository is a directory of training resources available in Cambridge and
nearby for basic bioinformatics processing and computational expertise in
handling big data. The resources listed here address the needs of
researchers in the SOMX and PREM themes at the [MRC Biostatistics
Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) but should be broadly applicable to other
themes and related research in other institutes.

The languages we have a particular focus on are R and Python although we are
aware MATLAB has many users and Julia is increasingly popular in this space.

Please feel free to update the information here. We would appreciate your
involvement to keep this resource up-to-date. If you know of any additional
courses or resources not listed below please either let me know or update the
repository directly. If you have taken any of the courses or used
any of the training resources below and have opinions or information that are
worth sharing, please add them to this document.


## Cambridge University training
There are several initiatives and departments that offer training to members of
the university. These include:

* A [Bioinformatics Training initiative](https://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate)
  that runs courses on basic skills and programming and more specialised courses.

* The [Cambridge Computational Biology Institute](https://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk/)
  runs an [MPhil in Computational Biology](http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mphil/compbio)
  which has several relevant courses including *genome informatics* and
  *scientific programming*.

* The [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) runs an [MPhil in
  Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs/index.html)
  that has several relevant courses including [Machine Learning and
  Algorithms for Data Mining](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/).

### Cambridge Big Data Initiative
Researchers at the university are able to
[join](https://www.bigdata.cam.ac.uk/contact-us/join-us) the Cambridge Big Data
Initiative. This includes subscription to a mailing list that provides regular
updates on big data related activities including training.


## MOOCs
[Massive Open Online
Courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) (MOOCs) are
an easily accessible way to pick up skills and expertise. The learning
experience depends a lot on the instructor(s) and the quality of the materials
they have created. Most courses use a mixture of instructional videos, multiple
choice tests and project work. Discussion forums are normally available to
encourage students to interact. Courses typically run on set dates perhaps
a few times a year although the instructional material may be available at
other times. Most courses require a few hours of participation each week. Some
require a small fee, others do not. Oftentimes official certification
of a student's result requires a fee.

### Coursera
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) is one of the largest MOOC websites.
A few relevant courses out of the many are:

* A very popular [bioinformatics
  specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)
  run by UCSD consisting of 7 courses.

* A [genomic data science
  specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)
  out of John Hopkins with 8 courses.

### Other notable providers
* [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)
* [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) is the largest UK based MOOC provider.
* [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
* [Stanford Online](http://online.stanford.edu/)


## Wellcome Genome Campus
The [Wellcome Genome
Campus](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/) which hosts
the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) and
[EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) runs some
bioinformatics courses. These are run on a commercial basis although bursaries
of up to 50% may be available.


## The Alan Turing Institute
The [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) is the national
institute for data science and runs [short
courses](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/) on all aspects of data science. It
is easily accessible from Cambridge by train (<50 minutes).


## MRC Biostatistics Unit
At the BSU John Reid is available to talk about any of the resources listed
above. Additionally Colin Starr is the main point of contact regarding high
performance computing.
