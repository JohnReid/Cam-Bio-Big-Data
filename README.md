## MOOCs
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are an easily accessible way to pick up
skills and expertise. The learning experience depends a lot on the
instructor(s) and the quality of the materials they have created. Most courses
use a mixture of instructional videos, multiple choice tests and project work.
Discussion forums are normally available to encourage students to interact.
Some courses require a small fee, others do not. Oftentimes official
certification of a student's result requires a fee.

### Coursera
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) is one of the largest MOOC websites.
A few relevant courses out of the many are:
* UCSD run a very popular [bioinformatics
  specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)
  consisting of 7 courses.
* John Hopkins run a [genomic data science
  specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)
  with 8 courses.
